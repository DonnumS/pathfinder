This is my take on the pathfinder visualizer made by Clément Mihailescu. Video link below <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak>

Test the [Demo](http://DonnumS.github.io/pathfinder)

## Planned App improvements

- [x] Navigation bar instead of plain buttons
- [x] Dropdown menu for selection algorithms
- [ ] Ability to move start and finish nodes
- [ ] Button for quickly creating a random maze
- [ ] Button that display popup with information about current selected algorithm

## Planned searching algorithms

These are the currently planned pathfinding algorithms I will implement

- [x] Dijkstra
- [x] DFS
- [x] BFS
- [x] AStar
- [ ] GreedyBFS
- [ ] DStar
